# Marionette Boilerplate

This is by no mean the definition of Marionette Boilerplate. After reading Derick Bailey's blog, he does not want to create any type of boilerpate for his Backbone.js framework project -- Marionette. I am not here to fill in the role for him but could not find any projects which could demostrate what I am trying to do, using Node.js as server, Require.js instead of Marionette's Module, Handlebars instead of Underscore templating system, and a way to organize the file structure inn the MVC style. That is why I create this boilerplate for my own personal studying. But I hope that someone could folk it and make it a really truly boilerplate.
